For this question my approach was to create a input function which will take string input from the user and with the help of input i am
changing the velocity of the turtle and printing the directions. 
While on the same time the subscriber node prints the x and y coordinates upto 2 decimals

problems:
    1.i initially tried to create a large class and then execute the functions in it but that somehow didnt work and had
    a lot of errors
    2.due to time constraint i couldnt initialize the bot to cartesian zero although i read that it uses /kill and /spawn to 
    restart the coordinates of the turtle sim
