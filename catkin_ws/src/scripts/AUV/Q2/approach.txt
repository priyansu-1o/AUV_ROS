For this question i thought of creating 3 nodes as given in question

1> one node (sender) publishes the multiples of 2 at a 2hz frequency
2> the second node (Multiplier) receives the multiples of 2 and then publishes the result after multiplying 10 to it
3> the third node (add5) adds five to the received data and prints the final result
