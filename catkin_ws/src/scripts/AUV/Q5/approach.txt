For this question i created a camlink node which will publish the ros image which we converted with the help of cvbridge.
the basic code of the camera pipeline is same as q4, i just tried to add a link between ros and depthai pipeline.
This was done with the help of cvbridge which converts rawimg to numpy arrays which cv2 uses.
I took help from deepseek for the syntax usage while using the cv2 bridge

SOME HUGE PROBLEMS I FACED:
    1 - while downloading opencv in my ubuntu os the ros file got corrupted and then it took me another 4 hrs to reinstall ros
    2 - as i rarely worked on git, even though creating a repo was easy but pushing the files into it had a lot of errors which i fixed
        using another method
