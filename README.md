<p>Hi AUV team! My name is Priyansu. In my first year, I tried learning C++, SQL, Python, and some Python modules like Pygame.</p>

<p>Regarding how my interest in robotics developedâ€”the <strong>SAMGATHAxVASHISHT</strong> event was the primary spark. Watching all the events made me feel that I should give robotics a try, as I was genuinely fascinated by the challenges this domain offers.<p>

<p>Because of this, I plan to learn Arduino during my summer vacation while also pursuing my interest in game development.</p>
